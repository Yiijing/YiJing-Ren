Here are three projects that I have worked on myself 😊

📍 China Earthquake Visualization Project

• Extracted earthquake data from the China Earthquake Networks Center and performed data cleaning andpreprocessing using Pandas. 
Analyzed datasets with Numpy Array, and visualzed the data using Matplotlib.

• Developed a data visualization interface based on the Vue.js framework to present multi-dimensionaleathquakedata analysis results.

📍 Hospital Physical Examination System and Diabetes Risk Forecast Project

• Designed and developed eight tables in the databese, including user profiles, patient records, healthpredictions and so on.

• Built a diabetes risk prediction model using machine learning (Logistic Regression), providing personalized risk assessments for patients. 
Analyzed diabetes patient data using Pandas and Numpy Array to extract insights.

• Developed a data visualization interface based on the Vue.is framework to present the results.

📍 Garbage Sorting System based on YOLOv8s

• The system adopts a hierarchical architecture design.
the front-end implements a visual interactive interface that supports multi-modal input (single image, batch image, video and camera detection) based on PyQt5.
the back-end combines OpenCV to realize garbage image detection and model inference classification.

•The model was trained on a Huawei public garbage sorting dataset (containing 44 types of garbage and 14,823 images) using YOLOv8s as the baseline network.
